description-category-network="This graph chart shows the subcategories&apos; topology belonging to the main category.<br> Having just one category (or level) is a bad practise on Wikimedia Commons because makes difficult to the community to find and use files. Instead a multilevel and articulated categorization permits a better reuse of the uploaded media.<br>This statistic is updated every day (max lag time 24h) and represents the actual scenario."
how-to-read-category-network=Each node represents a category, while the edges are the relations. Categories at the same level share the color. The bubble size is proportional to the amount of files within every category.
how-to-use-category-network=On the right menu you can order categories by level or by number of files. If you click into a category name the correspondant node will highlight (and viceversa).<br>On the top bar you can also drill-down to a chosen subdirectory.
use-case-category-network=With this graph you can understand if the media files of your interest are divided in a useful way. Probably a category with more then one hundred files needs to be splitted in two or more subcategories. In fact, the better a media is categorized on Wikimedia Commons, the more is probable to be viewed or used inside a Wikipedia page.<br>More info available on: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories</a>.
