description-category-network="This graph chart shows the subcategories&apos; topology belonging to the main category.<br> Having just one category (or level) is a bad practise on Wikimedia Commons because makes difficult to the community to find and use files. Instead a multilevel and articulated categorization permits a better reuse of the uploaded media.<br>This statistic is updated every day (max lag time 24h) and represents the actual scenario."
description-page-views=This line chart shows the sum of the views for the files thats belong to the main category with a 24h span.<br>Generally is quite visible the difference of visits between workdays and weekends. Sometimes some spikes could lead to a popular event. A growing trend is not always equals to a growing popularity of the category because of file additions.<br>This statistic is updated every day (max lag time 24h). The data collected here are taken from <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/mediacounts/daily/">https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/mediacounts/daily/</a>. A visit is recorded every time a device download a specific file from Wikimedia server. So it counts both puntual visits, both visits on pages where the file is present (but only if loaded on the device). Actually this is the most precise statistic released by Wikimedia servers.
how-to-read-category-network=Each node represents a category, while the edges are the relations. Categories at the same level share the color. The bubble size is proportional to the amount of files within every category.
how-to-read-page-views=On the horizontal axis we have time, with one day precision. On the vertical axis the total views performed by all files in the category. This axis has logarithmic scale.
how-to-use-category-network=On the right menu you can order categories by level or by number of files. If you click into a category name the correspondant node will highlight (and viceversa).<br>On the top bar you can also drill-down to a chosen subdirectory.
how-to-use-page-views=On the right menu you can order files by views, by median or by name.<br>On the top bar you can also drill-down to a chosen subdirectory or select your preferred time dimension.
use-case-category-network=With this graph you can understand if the media files of your interest are divided in a useful way. Probably a category with more then one hundred files needs to be splitted in two or more subcategories. In fact, the better a media is categorized on Wikimedia Commons, the more is probable to be viewed or used inside a Wikipedia page.<br>More info available on: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories</a>.
